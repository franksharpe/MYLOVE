    <p>Our holiday where I had the best time even though I got up at 6 am. 
        Put towels out for us not to use them. Ahah, I'm just kidding. I had the best time.</p>

    <p>The surprise I got after work doing bowling and 
        karaoke which I was real M and M</p>
    <br>
    <img src="1 (3).jpg" height="400px" width="300px">
    <br>
    <p>One of the first pictures we have together, one of the 
        first times around your house with your welcoming parents 
        and you, the best host ever in those PJs. I love the place and love 
        to be with you.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="1 (4).jpg" height="450px" width="300px">
    <br>
    <p>Oh, our holiday again, how amazing it was. 4 sleepovers could never have imagined, 
        your parents saying yes. It was the best, and I had the best time ever with you. I love you so much.</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <p>Our night out in Manchester or Manny as you like to call it. 
        Even though I'm sorry, I was a scary boy and wanted to go home in bed 
        and be in PJs with you instead of drinking after a little. 
        It doesn't matter what we do, even if it's watching paint dry, 
        I would do that with you. I love you so much, to the moon and back. 143.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="1 (6).jpg" height="300px" width="400px">
    <br>
    <p>IDK if you know this one, but maybe you do. It's the photo 
        taken when I asked you out that night. It's the start when 
        you had the coronation, and I was still too scared to go houses. 
        Well, we both were, and you came out. I was cleaning my car. Ahah, 
        way to be awkward, but still, it's such a special photo because it shows 
        the day I asked you out, even though you threw up on my car. Ahah, 
        I still loved you and knew I did and wanted to marry you so badly, 
        and still do if you ever give me the chance.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="1 (7).jpg" height="400px" width="300px">
    <br>
    <p>MY FAV PHOTO, well maybe the one you playing FIFA and the 
        one below are some of my fav, but this one OMG the end tho. 
        One of last nights of our holiday:(( where we missed 
        our bus, my fault having a poo, sorry, and then nearly missed 
        our plane again, my fault, sorry.</p>

    <p>Ella May Roberts, hopefully one day Ella May Sharpe or idm 
        being Frank Alexander Roberts if u want idm as long as I marry 
        you. Now I thought of this a lot ever since we started dating. 
        Just like I know I like blue on you, black is your fav colour. 
        You have blue eyes, you have blond hair, you have braces, 
        you have Rosie, your fav person. You have the best smile and laugh, 
        you are so funny yet I won't admit it, you are so smart. 
        You have this way to make me feel like it was okay when 
        I was even in 2k of debt. You have compassion for people, 
        when me, myself, wouldn't. You love dogs, you want a cat, rabbit, 
        horse for our house with the blue and copper and black taps 
        bathroom and kitchen. Mum even said about how planned out we are, 
        you want a Porsche GTRS 3 in pink, and I promise I'll get you one, 
        even if you have moved on, even if it meant selling everything I have. 
        I love you; I said it first to you, and I meant it. And when you 
        said 143 to me back, OMG, my heart raced, and I was the happiest person 
        you could be, and I still am because I'm still with you or hope <br>
        to be if you would please forgive me. <br><br>I'm sorry.</p>
    <br>

    <p>Another very cute photo of the person I love the most.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="1 (10).jpg" height="300px" width="400px">
    <br>
    <p>This one is a very cute one of you hugging me in Angle Bay. 
        That guy on the bike was there though at the end being weird, and 
        me trying to climb, and you telling me off. Ahah, jk, it was cute. 
        I'm glad you think of my safety; I love you so much.</p>

    <p>Ella doing her photography with the phone I just got myself, 
        which I defo didn't copy, I did. I did it because u wanted me to, 
        now we can be matching everything. Maybe I should get a scarf.</p>

    <p>AW, Ella and Dottie playing on the beach after dinner with my family. 
        I love that my family love you, and they do a lot, and I love 
        and hope your family love me because I love them so much.</p>

    <br>
    <p>MY FAV PHOTO again, I know, sorry, but this one, my two fav things. 
        After that went ice skating, which is the best with you. 
        <br>I love you so much; I just want you to love me again. I'm sorry.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="1 (14).jpg" height="400px" width="300px">
    <br>
    <p>Recent photo day you got the Porsche jumper which I love. 
        I love it so much; you make everything look great. You're so perfect 
        and pretty.</p>
    <br>
    <img src="1 (15).jpg" height="400px" width="300px">
    <br>
    <p>One of our first photos together; this one is so cute. 
        My hands awkward though, but I'm still scared. 
        I think of being in 
        your house; I am a bit more comfortable now, but then, OMG, it was 
        scary; every noise was scary. Ahah, but I love it now just like 
        <br>I love you.</p>
    <Br>
    <img src="1 (16).jpg" height="400px" width="300px">
    <br>
    <p>The day we went and got all the clothes at Trafford, 
        I went and got my coat which you picked because I care 
        only about if you think it's nice because I love you so much.</p>
    <br>

    <h1>I Love You Ella May Roberts, You Are the Love of My Life 143
        I have never stopped loving you at all, and that's the truth
        even if you did want to move on I couldn't and still would always
        love you. I really don't want us to end; I want to do anything I can
        to fix it. Please don't cut me out; I want to make it right. I'm
        sorry; please just tell me what I can do, and I'll do anything.
        I'll die if I can't have you. I love you so much to the moon and back.
        <br>
        To<br> My Ella
